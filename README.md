| Level name      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **None**        | Not used for writing log messages. Specifies that a logging category should not write any messages.                                                                                                  |
| **Critical**    | Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash, or a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention.                                                                        |
| **Error**       | Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure. These should indicate a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide failure.                        |
| **Warning**     | Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow, but do not otherwise cause the application execution to stop.                                                           |
| **Information** | Logs that track the general flow of the application. These logs should have long-term value.                                                                                                         |
| **Trace**       | Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data. These messages are disabled by default and should never be enabled in a production environment. |

**Example**

```
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Net002.Controllers.HelloWorldController": "Trace",
    }
  }
```

## Environment variables usage in configuration file

- `${CODENOW_EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE}` will be replaced with `CODENOW_EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE` env variable value

**Example**

```
  "CodeNowHelloWorldExampleUsageOfEnvVar": "${CODENOW_EXAMPLE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE}"
```
